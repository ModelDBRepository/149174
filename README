This is the readme for the model associated with the paper:

Thomas EA, Petrou S (2013) Network-specific mechanisms may explain the
paradoxical effects of carbamazepine and phenytoin. Epilepsia

These are the source files to generate Fig 2A (left panel) and the
data for Fig 4.

1) The first is Matlab code and demonstrates how the Markov model is
build from a Hodgkin Huxely model. Run Vclamp.m

2) The second is the network model. Do the usual NEURON thing to build
the mechanism executable. Edit runall.py to work with your environment
then run 'python ./runall.py' to submit the jobs that generate the
data.
